                    Here are the projects that I have been working on since 2017, when I started my journey on game development. 
                    Most of them are developed in C++. However, my earliest projects were done using the Unity engine and
                    lately I have been using the Rust programming language.

                                    Block Buster is a multiplayer voxel first person shooter made in C++. It features
                                    seven different types of weapons and four unique game modes. 
                                    Its most important feature is its own <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. The maps created
                                    using this tool can then be played on by uploading them to the match-making server, which
                                    is a different project made in Rust.
                                </p>

                                    I started this project so I could practice two subjects I was interested at
                                    the time: computer graphics and game networking. This was the first time I could
                                    practice all that I learned on the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorials.
                                    It was also a great opportunity to  try out a Client-Server architecture, a very different
                                    approach to the Lockstep technique I used in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a> development.

                                    This project as a whole, took almost one year to complete. However,
                                    most of the time I invested on this project during 2022 was almost exclusively
                                    dedicated to develop the client and the game's server.

                                    Block Buster is a multiplayer voxel first person shooter made in C++. It features
                                    seven different types of weapons and four unique game modes. 
                                    Its most important feature is its own Map editor. The maps created
                                    using this tool can then be played on by uploading them to the match-making server, which
                                    is a different project made in Rust.

                                    I started this project so I could practice two subjects I was interested at
                                    the time: computer graphics and game networking. This was the first time I could
                                    practice all that I learned on the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorials.
                                    It was also a great opportunity to  try out a Client-Server architecture, a very different
                                    approach to the Lockstep technique I used in <a href="#block-buster-game">Archer's Duel</a> development.

                                    This project as a whole, took almost one year to complete. However,
                                    most of the time I invested on this project during 2022 was almost exclusively
                                    dedicated to develop the client and the game's server.
