                    Here are the projects that I have been working on since 2017, when I started my journey on game development. 
                    Most of them are developed in C++. However, my earliest projects were done using the Unity engine and
                    lately I have been using the Rust programming language.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Block Buster is a multiplayer voxel first person shooter made in C++. It features
                                    seven different types of weapons and four unique game modes. 
                                    In addition, it counts with its own <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. The maps created
                                    using this tool can then be played on by uploading them to the <a href="#block-buster-matchmaking">match-making server</a>.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    I started this project so I could practice two subjects I was interested at
                                    the time: computer graphics, which I had previously learnt from the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorials, 
                                    and game networking. It was a great opportunity to try out implementing a Client-Server architecture, a very different
                                    approach to the Lockstep technique I used in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a> development.
                                    In order to provide a decent game experience over different network conditions, I did also had to implement
                                    fairly common game networking techniques, such as client prediction and entity interpolation.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This project as a whole, took almost one year to complete. However,
                                    most of the time I invested on this project during 2022 was almost exclusively
                                    dedicated to develop the client and the game's server.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This is the map editor tool for my voxel first person shooter <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a>. It allows
                                    users to create or modify maps that can be used in multiplayer games. It provides some basic tools to place, paint or remove blocks,
                                    but it also allows for more complex operations through its <em>select</em> tool. Typical functionality such as copy, cut, paste, undo, redo,
                                    search and replace, etc. is also supported. Game objects such as weapons, grenades, health packs, teleporters and more can also be placed
                                    around the map with the <em>Game Object</em> set of tools.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Providing a map editor was one of the main goals of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project. I love when a 
                                    game I like includes some sort of tool which allows for user created content, such as <em>Halo</em> with its <em>Forge</em>
                                    mode or <em>Advance Wars</em> with its <em>Design room</em>, specially when that content can be used in multiplayer gameplay. In my opinion,
                                    including such a tool provides huge benefits at a rather small cost: it provides a way to produce free content for your game and keep its
                                    community active.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The map editor was the first part of the project I implemented. The first ready-to-use version of the tool took around 3 months
                                    to create. However, as the main project was developed, further modifications and optimizations had to be made to this tool.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This program is one of my set of projects which are of part of <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a>, my voxel multiplayer first person shooter.
                                    The match-making server provides a REST API which is used by the game clients to find, create and join multiplayer games. Additionally, it also allows users to share the maps
                                    they created using the <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. Unlike the other <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> set of projects, this one is made in Rust, instead of C++.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Another of the main goals of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project was to provide online multiplayer functionality. A subset of issues that arise when making this decision have to do
                                    with how the client connects to a game server. Does the player have to type the server's address they wish to connect to? Do they simply press a button which then puts the in an apparently random match?
                                    Or can they choose a match within a list of already created games? The first case was a path that I already explored when I was working in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a>, so I opted for the third
                                    option this time.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> As you may have noticed, due to the project's name you might have thought that I had chosen the second option, and you'd be almost right. That was the first idea,
                                    which gave birth to the project and its name, but it was never implemented. I opted for the server brower approach very early on development, the name stayed the same, however. So I do agree that it may be a bit misleading.

                                    Block Buster is a multiplayer voxel first person shooter made in C++. It features
                                    seven different types of weapons and four unique game modes. 
                                    Its most important feature is its own Map editor. The maps created
                                    using this tool can then be played on by uploading them to the match-making server, which
                                    is a different project made in Rust.

                                    I started this project so I could practice two subjects I was interested at
                                    the time: computer graphics and game networking. This was the first time I could
                                    practice all that I learned on the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorials.
                                    It was also a great opportunity to  try out a Client-Server architecture, a very different
                                    approach to the Lockstep technique I used in <a href="#block-buster-game">Archer's Duel</a> development.

                                    This project as a whole, took almost one year to complete. However,
                                    most of the time I invested on this project during 2022 was almost exclusively
                                    dedicated to develop the client and the game's server.
