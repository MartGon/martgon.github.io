                    Here are the projects that I have been working on since 2017, when I started my journey on game development as a hobby. 
                    Most of them are developed in C++. However, my earliest projects were done using the Unity engine and
                    lately I have been using the Rust programming language.

                                    This is my second work in progress attempt at making an Advance Wars clone, my <a href="#awc">first one</a> taking back
                                    to late 2020. Instead of resuming the development of the original project, I decided to start over, but using the Rust programming 
                                    language as baseline this time, while also trying to avoid some mistakes of the past by taking a design-first approach. 
                                    What I aim with this project is to make an engine which can be used to recreate the original game, 
                                    while still leaving room to make some modifications to the formula, such as adding new attack or movement patterns, effects that can
                                    trigger after certain events or conditions are met, etc.

                                    This is a work in progress, so there are still some key features missing. At the moment of writing this, a few basics
                                    features have already been implemented: basic map rendering, loading of unit/tiles sprites, map/unit/tile data serialization, turn/event/team system and the
                                    movement command. Sadly, these are not enough to play a full game, because features such as an attack command or a win condition system have not been implemented 
                                    yet. These are some of the features planned for the first complete version:

                                    Block Buster is a multiplayer voxel first person shooter made in C++. It features
                                    seven different types of weapons and four unique game modes. 
                                    In addition, it counts with its own <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. The maps created
                                    using this tool can then be played on by uploading them to the <a href="#block-buster-matchmaking">match-making server</a>.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    I started this project so I could practice two subjects I was interested at
                                    the time: computer graphics, which I had previously learnt from the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorials, 
                                    and game networking. It was a great opportunity to try out implementing a Client-Server architecture, a very different
                                    approach to the Lockstep technique I used in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a> development.
                                    In order to provide a decent game experience over different network conditions, I did also had to implement
                                    fairly common game networking techniques, such as client prediction, entity interpolation and lag compensation.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This project as a whole, took almost one year to complete. However,
                                    most of the time I invested on this project during 2022 was almost exclusively
                                    dedicated to develop the client and the game's server.
                                </p>

                                    This is the map editor tool for my voxel first person shooter <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a>. It allows
                                    users to create or modify maps that can be used in multiplayer games. It provides some basic tools to place, paint or remove blocks,
                                    but it also allows for more complex operations through its <em>select</em> tool. Typical functionality such as copy, cut, paste, undo, redo,
                                    search and replace, etc. is also supported. Game objects such as weapons, grenades, health packs, teleporters and more can also be placed
                                    around the map with the <em>Game Object</em> set of tools.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Providing a map editor was one of the main goals of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project. I love when a 
                                    game I like includes some sort of tool which allows for user created content, such as <em>Halo</em> with its <em>Forge</em>
                                    mode or <em>Advance Wars</em> with its <em>Design room</em>, specially when that content can be used in multiplayer gameplay. In my opinion,
                                    including such a tool provides huge benefits at a rather small cost: it provides a way to produce free content for your game and keep its
                                    community active.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The map editor was the first part of the project I implemented. The first ready-to-use version of the tool took around 3 months
                                    to create. However, as the main project was developed, further modifications and optimizations had to be made.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This program is one of my set of projects which are of part of <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a>, my voxel multiplayer first person shooter.
                                    The match-making server provides a REST API which is used by the game clients to find, create and join multiplayer games. Additionally, it also allows users to share the maps
                                    they created using the <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. Unlike the other <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> set of projects, this one is made in Rust, instead of C++.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Another of the main goals of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project was to provide online multiplayer functionality. A subset of issues that arise when making this decision have to do
                                    with how the client connects to a game server. Does the player have to type the server's address they wish to connect to? Do they simply press a button which then puts the in an apparently random match?
                                    Or can they choose a match within a list of already created games? The first case was a path that I already explored when I was working in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a>, so I opted for the third
                                    option this time.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> As you may have noticed, due to the project's name you might have thought that I had chosen the second option, and you'd be almost right. That was the first idea,
                                    which gave birth to the project and its name, but it was never implemented. I opted for the server brower approach very early on development, the name stayed the same, however. So I do agree that it may be a bit misleading.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    <em>rs-lag</em> is the first project I developed in Rust. This program works as an UDP proxy to simulate network conditions. 
                                    Different network parameters, such as RTT, jitter, packet loss, packet duplication and packtet unordering can be configured through its command line interface.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    After a few years practicing C++, and experiencing some of the common problems that arise when using it,
                                    I thought it was a good moment to try out a new programming language. I had already used C#, when working on some of my Unity projects, and I was also tired of Java, because 
                                    we employed it a lot during my bachelor, so those two were not an option. I particularly enjoy low level languages because of the degree of control they provide, but I also don't like to miss out some
                                    of the handy high-level features, such as containers or a basic OS abstraction layer. In my opinion, Rust has the best of both worlds.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Developing this program was a nice opportunity to put in practice what I learnt reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>. 
                                    At this time I already had started what would be the foundations of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project, so I knew that I would have to test its networking implementation somehow.
                                    After checking that Rust provided basic UDP sockets functionality, the decision was already made.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    AWC is probably my most chaotic project. By its name, you may think that this is simply another Advance Wars clone, but it's actually a library.
                                    A library I made with the intention of providing some core functionality to implement any 2D turn based strategy game. It was my first project to support Lua
                                    scripting, which can be used to create maps and units. I also made a <a href="https://github.com/MartGon/CLIChess">CLI implementation of chess</a> 
                                    using the library in order to test how it would be used in actual projects.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    I said this project was chaotic because it lacked a clear vision. When I started the development, I didn't clearly know what I wanted this project to be.
                                    At the first, my intention was to make an Advance Wars clone. But then I thought that with a good design (which I didn't achieve) I could reuse some parts of the program
                                    to make my own original strategy game. After that, the idea of making a library came up. I wanted to detach the game logic from its representation after all...
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Despite the fact that I am not entirely happy with how this project came out, I think it was a good opportunity to achieve some goals: practicing unit testing and Lua scripting integration.
                                    At the moment of writing this, I'm still unsure whether I'm going to continue this project some day or if I'll end up redoing it from scratch, maybe even in a different language, such as Rust.
                                    Only time will tell.

                                    Space Rogue is a game where you play as a bounty hunter doing a scavenge mission on a territory packed with hostile spaceships. During your mission,
                                    an old massive star died, triggering a supernova which you must escape from. The game features three different weapons and two different game modes:
                                    
                                    <ul><strong>Race</strong>: You must escape from the explosion while dealing with enemies and different obstacles along the way.</ul>
                                    <ul><strong>Scavenge</strong>: You need to recover 30 resources. However, you'll still need to fight enemies and avoid the explosion.</ul>
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This was a group project I made with some friends using the Unity engine. Due to COVID-19,
                                    most of my friends and I were stuck at home, so one day that we were particularly bored, I proposed (intially as a joke) that we should make
                                    a game together. To my surprise, the idea was actually very well recieved. We decided that everyone should 
                                    bring some game ideas that we then could discuss. After careful consideration, we realized that most of these ideas
                                    were too ambitious, so we thought the best plan would be to work in two groups of four people and make a fairly simple game in three weeks or less. 
                                    That way, everyone could get some practice working in making games as a team.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The game was initally planned to be a Jet Fighter clone, but due to my previous experience
                                    with procedural content generation we decided to take a fairly different approach. The obstacles and enemy placement would
                                    be different each attempt, and the scenario is pseudo infinite. To keep it simple, we opted to design only three types 
                                    of enemies (which are implemented using steering behaviours) and three types of weapons or power ups.

                                    This project was made by the team I was part of, (very originally) called <em>Team 1</em>. The game made by
                                    <em>Team 2</em> is a very funny and bizarre take on <em>Mario Kart</em>, appropiately called <em>Mario Car: Wild & Furious</em>. Make sure to check It

                                <!--

                                    On August 26, 2019 <i>World of Warcraft Classic</i> was launched. <i>World of Warcraft</i> was a game that I had
                                    enjoyed a lot during my teenage years, and this was a return to it's first version (November, 2004), which
                                    I missed the first time around. By the time I started playing the game,
                                    <i>The Burning Crusade</i> (January, 2007) had already been released, which made many different changes to the original game.
                                    Playing the <i>Classic</i> version was quite an enjoyable experience, specially during the first weeks after launch. However, after
                                    a few months, it was not uncommon to witness one the major problems that this game has always had: Bots. After taking some lessons about reverse engineer during my Cybersecurity master and watching so many bots 
                                    running rampant while playing the game, it sparked my interested: I'm sure I can make my own.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    With this objective in mind I started my research. After a quick <i>Google</i> search I found <a href="https://www.ownedcore.com/">Ownedcore</a>, an online videogame hacking forum which was my starting point
                                    in this journey. Even though many of the posts were outdated (as they were more than a decade old), so many valuable information could still be extracted from them:
                                    which books I should read, which tools I could use, how the game stores data about the game objects, different approaches about how reading that information and interacting with the game, etc.
                                </p>
                                -->

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    After playing the game during around 3 months and wactching so many bots running wild, I decided to make my own.
                                    Given the game was 15 years old at the time, I was sure that making my own would be feasible, as there should be a decent amount of information online about how the game works internally.
                                    I also saw this as a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge about reverse engineering and game development.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    It took me 3 months of work while stuck at home due to the pandemic, but I came up with a Bot which was able to <i>farm</i> (that's killing monsters and gathering resources) dungeons repeatedly.
                                    You can watch it working in this <i>YouTube</i> video. Here's a extremely summarized explanation of what's going on:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                            A <i>DLL</i> (Dynamic Link Library) programmed in C++ is injected into the game's process, which opens a console window,
                                            printing log information. This approach allows us to read/write memory and call game functions within its address space.
                                            The memory location of relevant functions and game data were previously gathered by reverse engineering the game's executable file.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        
                                        <li>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                            Periodically, the bot attempts to connect to a Python3 Server to receive the instructions which the player character should perform during a given session. With this, we avoid recompiling the 
                                            <i>DLL</i> every time we want the bot to do a different activity. The set of actions (a behaviour) are recorded and stored in JSON files using a different Python3 program, which also communicates with the Bot
                                            to obtain information from the game. Among the actions that can be recorded and then performed by the bot, we have: Move or wait in a specific location, attract enemy NPCs within a radius, use an ability, kill enemies, etc.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        
                                        <li>
                                            Once the set of actions is received by the Bot, the fun begins! In this case, the bot runs through the dungeon attracting some enemies, stacks them in a specific location, and then engages in combat with them.
                                            After all enemies are dead, it gathers all the loot from them, and returns to the initial position. Finally, the bot sells all the loot that was gathered to a vendor NPC.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    All the testing was done in my own private <i>World of Warcraft</i> server, powered by <a href="https://www.trinitycore.org/">Trinity Core</a>, an open source project which I had contributed to in the past.
                                    Finally, here are some of the tools and libraries that I used while working in this project:
                                    <ul>

                                        <li><a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/">Cheat Engine</a> (Memory reader)</li>
                                        <li><a href="https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook">MinHook</a> (Function Hook library)</li>
                                        <li><a href="https://github.com/JustasMasiulis/xorstr">xortrs</a> (Compile-time string encryption library)</li>
                                        <li><a href="https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector">Extreme Injector</a> (DLL Injector)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Before this bot, I made another version which had a strong focus in undetection, as I was initally planning to use it in the official servers, and I didn't want to get banned by <i>Blizzard</i>. The first version worked by using
                                    a kernel driver to read memory from the game's process. Then, this data would be sent through a socket to a Python3 program which would control the player character by simulating mouse and keyboard input. Additional information was also obtained
                                    from the game by reading pixels. Due to the fact that <i>World of Warcraft</i> has its own Lua API, which allows users to create <i>addons</i> to modify the UI or provide some utility for the game, I created my own <i>addon</i> to
                                    show data codified as pixel colors. However, only simple tasks such as moving and clicking on game objects could realiably be achieved with this design. Injecting a DLL to call game functions provides much more flexibility, at the risk of being more easily
                                    detected by an anti-cheat.
                                </p>

                                    DroidRisk is an Android malware classification tool which I presented as my Cybersecurity master's thesis. It's implemented on Python3, using the scikit-learn library. 
                                    My approach is purely based on static analysis with the objective of achieving early detection of malware. In order to do this, I had to train four different AI models, each of them
                                    with static features of a particular category, such as Android permissions or the strings found within the app. 
                                    After ensuring the validity of the results employing <em>10 Fold cross validation</em>, the program scores 98% accuracy by combining the results of the four models.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The original idea was proposed to me by my professor. I decided to make this project because I thought it would be interesting to work in something related with AI. At that time, I already was planning to make an strategy game some day
                                    so I thought that this could be a great opportunity to learn something that I might be able to apply to it. 
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Even though AI is a topic I am not as passionate about as game development, it was still a fun and interesting experience. Previously to the development phase,
                                    I had to do intensive research of the state of the art and came with the idea of using <em>Ensemble Learning</em> after checking that the concept wasn't particularly explored
                                    in Android malware classification. Despite the fact that it wasn't necessary, I decided to assemble my own dataset of samples, which was made of around 800 applications, half of them being malware. 
                                    I found my malware samples using the webpage <a href="https://koodous.com">Koodous</a>, which is a collaborative platform were applications are uploaded at a daily basis and they are classified by many malware analysts.
                                    The so called <em>goodware</em> samples were obtained from Google Play.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    In Archer's Duel you play as an archer defending your tower from the enemy archers. You must destroy their tower
                                    before they destroy yours! For this purpose, you can combine up to six different power ups,
                                    and a powerful cannon shot that can be unlocked during a match. You can play against
                                    the AI or against your friends through its online multiplayer mode.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    What started as one of the many clones of the popular flash game <em>Archer</em>, became its own thing after many
                                    redesigns that were made during early development. Unlike <em>Archer</em>, I wanted the game to be much more
                                    fast paced, so I allowed players to move and jump around their tower, while keeping the ability to charge their
                                    shots. Making the gameplay more dynamic, made using <em>Lockstep</em> for online multiplayer almost mandatory, as I needed
                                    to have all clients involved perfectly in sync. This adds some input lag when playing online, because all other clients' inputs
                                    are needed before rendering a frame.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    In an attempt to make each match different, I added six different power ups which randomly spawn around the map and have
                                    to be shot by players in order to use them. The power ups you unlock can have crazy synergies. For instance, you can
                                    combine the <em>triple arrow</em> power up with the <em>fire arrow</em> one, to start shooting three fire arrows! I did also 
                                    add a <em>killing spree like</em> reward by giving players the ability to charge a powerful cannon shot, which unlocks by dealing damage
                                    to the enemy tower or hitting the enemy archers with your arrows. This way you can try different strategies to win a game.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    SDL Pong is a clone of the classic game Pong. It features three modes: single player, a local multiplayer (using one keyboard) and a very naive implementation
                                    of an online multiplayer. In order to make it a bit different, I made the following changes: the ball's speed increases after each bounce and the angle it takes, when hitting one of the paddles, changes based on
                                    the distance between the collision point and the center of the paddle.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    My first project ever made in C++. After messing with the Unity engine for some time, which I used to make my bachelor's thesis about procedural content generation, I wanted to take a step forward and learn the language that
                                    is the standard for game development. This was also my first contact with the SDL set of libraries, which I still use in my projects to this day. Due to the fact that the objective was to learn the
                                    basics of the language, I opted to make a really simple game, such as Pong clone.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Needlessly to say, this project is full of raw pointers, memory leaks, and code in general that causes undefined behaviour. Today, I'm happy to say that my knowledge of the language has improved quite 
                                    drastically and now I avoid most of the common pitfalls that can be found in this project.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Map Gen is part of my bachelor's thesis about procedural content generation. With this tool, 
                                    2D tile-based strategy maps can be generated. Some generation parameters can be tweaked to obtain different
                                    results. Some of these parameters are: the size of the map, land, mountain and forest density, 
                                    the amount of resources scattered around the map, whether to trace roads between the bases, etc.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The map generation process is fairly simple, and it somewhat resembles Conway's game of life:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>The entire map is filled with water tiles.</li>
                                            <li>A bounded random number of land tiles are placed in random positions on the map.</li>
                                            <li>A random amount of iterations is run. On each iteration, each land tile attempts to expand to
                                            its neighbour cells, based on some probability. The chance to expand is reduced on each iteration. </li>
                                            <li>Steps 1 to 3 are applied for mountain tiles, but with a tweak: mountain tiles can only be placed on land tiles, instead of any tile.</li>
                                            <li>Steps 1 to 3 are repeated for forest tiles. Similarly, forests can only spawn on grass tiles.</li>
                                            <li>Player bases are places in random positions around the map, attempting to maximize distance between them.</li>
                                            <li>Optionally, roads are built between the two bases. The path the road takes is calculated using Dijkstra's Algorithm, where
                                                each tile is given an arbitrary cost. Water has the highest travel cost, while land has the lowest.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>As an option, resources are placed around the map. However, in an attempt to reach some balance, we use again
                                                Dijkstra's Algorithm so the resources are placed <em>symmetrically</em>. By <em>symmetrically</em> I mean that 
                                                when a specific resource is placed in a random position at a given distance to a player's base, another one is placed
                                                with the same travel distance to the other player's base. That way, both players have the same amount of resources and at similar distance within
                                                their reach.
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This is one of my four games that make up my bachelor's thesis about procedural content generation. It's a rogue-like shooter where you explore sci-fi dungeons which are procedurally generated.
                                    Along the way, you'll find different enemies whose power increases as you go deeper into the dungeon. In order to progress in some levels, you'll have to find keys to open 
                                    the gates that lead to the next floor. During you exploration, you may also find different weapons which can aid you in your quest.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The process to generate the dungeon is based on binary space partition, which generates a graph model. Each leaf node of the graph corresponds to a rooom in the dungeon, and the connections
                                    between them are made by following the graph. That is, a room can only connect to another only if they have the same parent on the upper graph level. The rooms are connected to each other using corridors,
                                    whose path is calculated using the A* algorithm, a variation of Dijkstra's.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The placement of keys is done following the graph model as well, and it's dependant on which room the player spawns. 
                                    This is necessary in order to avoid generating a dungeon which is impossible to complete, because a key could end up being placed behind its corresponding gate. Due to the fact that the graph
                                    represents how the rooms are connected, this situation can be avoided.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    MyCraft is another of my four games that make up my bachelor's thesis about procedural content generation. This is of course an extremely limited <em>Minecraft</em> clone. Similarly to the original,
                                    you can choose a seed before entering the world which will dictate its shape. Once it loads, you can freely move through a pseudo infinite procedurally generated landscape.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Making a <em>Minecraft</em> clone wasn't necessarily planned before I started the project, but I was sure that it was something that I wanted and had to explore. That way, I discovered that 
                                    <em>Minecraft's</em> terrain is generated using Perlin noise. Perlin noise is sampled using a <em>vec2</em> and it has the special property that the closer the sampling indices are, the higher
                                    the correlation is between the sampled values. This allows the generation of terrains that look more natural and organic, instead of chaotic spikes or pits that would be obtained if using a different
                                    pseudo random number generator.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    In order to increase performance during gameplay, I had to do few a optimizations. As in the original game, blocks are distributed into groups, called <em>chunks</em>. Due to the fact that the
                                    terrain is generated during gameplay, more chunks need to be loaded as the player moves around the world. However, in order to prevent loading all chunks at the same time, 
                                    the game will stop loading those chunks which are far away from the player. 
                                </p>

                                    Before you start, you can choose the size of the maze and the algorithm which is used to generate it. Starting from the red square, you need to reach the green one to win!

                                    Including a project which used maze generation as part of a project about procedural content generation felt almost mandatory. There's plenty of research made already on this topic, so I decided
                                    to include three different generation algorithms. Mazes generated by each of these algorithms have their own set of features:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Depth-First Search</strong>: Produces a maze with a very long main path, with very short branches. Therefore, is quite hard to get lost during exploration. Perfect for adventure games</li>
                                        <li><strong>Prim's Algorithm</strong>: Produces a maze with many branches but which are usually short on length. This makes it fairly easy to get lost.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Space Partition</strong>: Mazes generated by this algorithm tend to be quite chaotic, which alternate between very long and very short paths.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    As you may have noticed, most of these algorithms come from graph theory. They are used in that field as different ways to explore all nodes in graph, with different purposes. For instance, Prim's algorithm
                                    is used to calculate the shortest spanning tree. The property of these algorithms ensures that the maze will always have a solution, as all nodes or cells can be reached from any other.

                                    Hard Trip was my first contact ever with game development. It's a game made with the Unity engine, where you play as soldier who's defending a caravan of three horse carriages from the many threats
                                    that exist within the Brenner Gorge, such as bandits and wolves. In order to complete the first (and only) level, you'll have to traverse three main sections, where you may find
                                    some key items that will aid you in your journey, known as <em>clues</em>, defended by enemy forces. In each section, there are two different paths that the caravan may take. The caravan will
                                    choose one of them depending on the clues you found on the previous section. However, you'll have to take the careful decision of choosing the first path the caravan takes.

                                    This project was part of a subject I had during the last course of my bachelor. It was made in collaboration with students of a different bachelor, who had a subject about game design. The game itself
                                    is lightly inspired on a fragment of a novel of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saramago">José Saramago</a>, <em>The Elephant's Journey</em>. The game was made within the span of four months, with
                                    a team of six people: four programmers and two designers. The game underwent many redesigns during development, and due the fact the none of us had any previous experience using the Unity engine or game development 
                                    for that matter, the final product may be lacking in the content side. However, we're all quite happy about how it turned out.

                                    Despite the fact that, towards the end, working on the game became quite stressful because we had to meet strict deadlines. However, it was a great experience overall, which I'd  gladly repeat.
