                    Here are the projects that I have been working on since 2017, when I started my journey on game development as a hobby. 
                    Most of them are developed in C++. However, my earliest projects were done using the Unity engine and
                    lately I have been using the Rust programming language.

                    <div id="block-buster-game" class="project-container">
                        <div class="project-content">

                                <h3>Block Buster - Game</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Block Buster is a multiplayer voxel first person shooter made in C++. It features
                                    seven different types of weapons and four unique game modes. 
                                    In addition, it counts with its own <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. The maps created
                                    using this tool can then be played on by uploading them to the <a href="#block-buster-matchmaking">match-making server</a>.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    I started this project so I could practice two subjects I was interested at
                                    the time: computer graphics, which I had previously learnt from the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorials, 
                                    and game networking. It was a great opportunity to try out implementing a Client-Server architecture, a very different
                                    approach to the Lockstep technique I used in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a> development.
                                    In order to provide a decent game experience over different network conditions, I did also had to implement
                                    fairly common game networking techniques, such as client prediction, entity interpolation and lag compensation.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This project as a whole, took almost one year to complete. However,
                                    most of the time I invested on this project during 2022 was almost exclusively
                                    dedicated to develop the client and the game's server.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This is the map editor tool for my voxel first person shooter <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a>. It allows
                                    users to create or modify maps that can be used in multiplayer games. It provides some basic tools to place, paint or remove blocks,
                                    but it also allows for more complex operations through its <em>select</em> tool. Typical functionality such as copy, cut, paste, undo, redo,
                                    search and replace, etc. is also supported. Game objects such as weapons, grenades, health packs, teleporters and more can also be placed
                                    around the map with the <em>Game Object</em> set of tools.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Providing a map editor was one of the main goals of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project. I love when a 
                                    game I like includes some sort of tool which allows for user created content, such as <em>Halo</em> with its <em>Forge</em>
                                    mode or <em>Advance Wars</em> with its <em>Design room</em>, specially when that content can be used in multiplayer gameplay. In my opinion,
                                    including such a tool provides huge benefits at a rather small cost: it provides a way to produce free content for your game and keep its
                                    community active.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The map editor was the first part of the project I implemented. The first ready-to-use version of the tool took around 3 months
                                    to create. However, as the main project was developed, further modifications and optimizations had to be made.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This program is one of my set of projects which are of part of <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a>, my voxel multiplayer first person shooter.
                                    The match-making server provides a REST API which is used by the game clients to find, create and join multiplayer games. Additionally, it also allows users to share the maps
                                    they created using the <a href="#block-buster-editor">map editor</a>. Unlike the other <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> set of projects, this one is made in Rust, instead of C++.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Another of the main goals of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project was to provide online multiplayer functionality. A subset of issues that arise when making this decision have to do
                                    with how the client connects to a game server. Does the player have to type the server's address they wish to connect to? Do they simply press a button which then puts the in an apparently random match?
                                    Or can they choose a match within a list of already created games? The first case was a path that I already explored when I was working in <a href="#archers-duel">Archer's Duel</a>, so I opted for the third
                                    option this time.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> As you may have noticed, due to the project's name you might have thought that I had chosen the second option, and you'd be almost right. That was the first idea,
                                    which gave birth to the project and its name, but it was never implemented. I opted for the server brower approach very early on development, the name stayed the same, however. So I do agree that it may be a bit misleading.

                                    <em>rs-lag</em> is the first project I developed in Rust. This program works as an UDP proxy to simulate network conditions. 
                                    Different network parameters, such as RTT, jitter, packet loss, packet duplication and packtet unordering can be configured through its command line interface.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    After a few years practicing C++, and experiencing some of the common problems that arise when using it,
                                    I thought it was a good moment to try out a new programming language. I had already used C#, when working on some of my Unity projects, and I was also tired of Java, because 
                                    we employed it a lot during my bachelor, so those two were not an option. I particularly enjoy low level languages because of the degree of control they provide, but I also don't like to miss out some
                                    of the handy high-level features, such as containers or a basic OS abstraction layer. In my opinion, Rust has the best of both worlds.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Developing this program was a nice opportunity to put in practice what I learnt reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>. 
                                    At this time I already had started what would be the foundations of the <a href="#block-buster">Block Buster</a> project, so I knew that I would have to test its networking implementation somehow.
                                    After checking that Rust provided basic UDP sockets functionality, the decision was already made.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    AWC is probably my most chaotic project. By its name, you may think that this is simply another Advance Wars clone, but it's actually a library.
                                    A library I made with the intention of providing some core functionality to implement any 2D turn based strategy game. It was my first project to support Lua
                                    scripting, which can be used to create maps and units. I also made a <a href="https://github.com/MartGon/CLIChess">CLI implementation of chess</a> 
                                    using the library in order to test how it would be used in actual projects.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    I said this project was chaotic because it lacked a clear vision. When I started the development, I didn't clearly know what I wanted this project to be.
                                    At the first, my intention was to make an Advance Wars clone. But then I thought that with a good design (which I didn't achieve) I could reuse some parts of the program
                                    to make my own original strategy game. After that, the idea of making a library came up. I wanted to detach the game logic from its representation after all...
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Despite the fact that I am not entirely happy with how this project came out, I think it was a good opportunity to achieve some goals: practicing unit testing and Lua scripting integration.
                                    At the moment of writing this, I'm still unsure whether I'm going to continue this project some day or if I'll end up redoing it from scratch, maybe even in a different language, such as Rust.
                                    Only time will tell.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    Space Rogue is a game where you play as a bounty hunter doing a scavenge mission on a territory packed with hostile spaceships. During your mission,
                                    an old massive star died, triggering a supernova which you must escape from. The game features three different weapons and two different game modes:
                                    
                                    <ul><strong>Race</strong>: You must escape from the explosion while dealing with enemies and different obstacles along the way.</ul>
                                    <ul><strong>Scavenge</strong>: You need to recover 30 resources. However, you'll still need to fight enemies and avoid the explosion.</ul>
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    This was a group project I made with some friends using the Unity engine. Due to COVID-19,
                                    most of my friends and I were stuck at home, so one day that we were particularly bored, I proposed (intially as a joke) that we should make
                                    a game together. To my surprise, the idea was actually very well recieved. We decided that everyone should 
                                    bring some game ideas that we then could discuss. After careful consideration, we realized that most of these ideas
                                    were too ambitious, so we thought the best plan would be to work in two groups of four people and make a fairly simple game in three weeks or less. 
                                    That way, everyone could get some practice working in making games as a team.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The game was initally planned to be a Jet Fighter clone, but due to my previous experience
                                    with procedural content generation we decided to take a fairly different approach. The obstacles and enemy placement would
                                    be different each attempt, and the scenario is pseudo infinite. To keep it simple, we opted to design only three types 
                                    of enemies (which are implemented using steering behaviours) and three types of weapons or power ups.

                                    This project was made by the team I was part of, (very originally) called <em>Team 1</em>. The game made by
                                    <em>Team 2</em> is a very funny and bizarre take on <em>Mario Kart</em>, appropiately called <em>Mario Car: Wild & Furious</em>. Make sure to check It

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    In spite of the fact that this project is not directly related with game development, I've decided to included it, as it was still quite interesting to make. 
                                    DroidRisk is an Android malware classification tool which I presented as my Cybersecurity master project. It's implemented on Python3, using the scikit-learn library. 
                                    My approach is purely based on static analysis with the objective of achieving early detection of malware. In order to do this, I had to train four different AI models, each of them
                                    with static features of a particular category, such as Android permissions or the strings found within the app. 
                                    After ensuring that the validity of the results employing <em>10 Fold cross validation</em>, the program scores 98% accuracy by combining the results of the four models.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    The original idea was proposed to me by my professor. I decided to make this project because I thought it would be interesting to work in something related with AI. At that time, I already was planning to make an strategy game some day
                                    so I thought that this could be a great opportunity to learn something that I might be able to apply to it. 
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Even though AI is a topic I am not as passionate about as game development, it was still a fun experience. Previously to the development phase,
                                    I had to do intensive research of the state of the art and came with the idea of using <em>Ensemble Learning</em> after checking that the concept wasn't particularly explored
                                    in Android malware classification. Despite the fact that it wasn't necessary, I decided to assemble my own dataset of samples, which was made of around 800 applications, half of them being malware. 
                                    I found my malware samples using the webpage <a href="https://koodous.com">Koodous</a>, which is a collaborative platform were applications are uploaded at a daily basis and they are classified by many malware analysts.
                                    The so called <em>goodware</em> samples were obtained from Google Play.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    In Archer's Duel you play as an archer defending your tower from the enemy archers. You must destroy their tower
                                    before they destroy yours! For this purpose, you can combine up to six different power ups which synergize with each other,
                                    and a powerful cannon shot that unlocks once you've dealed enough damage to the enemy tower. You can play against
                                    the AI or against your friends through its online multiplayer mode.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                                    What started as one of the many clones of the popular flash game <em>Archer</em>, became its own thing after many
                                    redesigns that were made during development. Unlike <em>Archer</em>, I wanted the game to be much more
                                    fast paced, so I allowed player to move and jump around their tower, while keeping the ability to charge their
                                    shots. 
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    In an attempt to make each match different, I added six different power ups which randomly spawned around the map and had
                                    to be shot by players in order to use them. The power ups you unlock can have crazy synergies. For instance, you can
                                    combine the <em>triple arrow</em> power up with the <em>fire arrow</em> one, to start shooting three fire arrows! I did also 
                                    add a <em>killing spree like</em> reward by giving players to charge a powerful cannon shot, which unlocks by dealing damage
                                    to the enemy tower or hitting the enemy archers with your arrows. This way you can try different strategies to win.
